  I'm a Hungarian student at the end of secondary school. I learned some basic
  programming in Basic (sorry) from my father about ten years ago, and I've been
  fascinated by computers ever since. As a consequence I learned English, and
  then as much about software as I could when we got an Internet connection.

  I love music. I listen to music whenever I can - it helps to take a break from
  time to time when learning boring stuff for school (hopefully that's over
  now). It's also been shown by some research or other that rock music spins the
  brain up. Just what I need :)<br />
  I listen mostly to music that's somewhere between rock, metal and blues. Think
  Clutch. Other than that, I like any music that's good. Well... apart from
  techno and all the similar stuff I don't know the proper name of.

  The above-mentioned Internet connection was followed shortly by a switch to
  Ubuntu, and lately to Arch Linux. That was a really defining experience - if
  nothing else, it defined my working environment (yeah, that was a joke. I'm not
  really great with jokes in English). I spent a lot of time learning different
  programming languages and techniques. Paradigms as well. I don't like such
  big and serious words, but that's what they're called. Right now I do some work
  developing web applications.
</p>
<p>
  The biggest gain in learning different languages seems to be not that I can
  read (and write) programs written in them - you can usually read any
  programming language after learning two or three using the same paradigm. The
  biggest gain is that every language has a slightly different way of solving
  problems, so my toolbox I can use in any language growed.

  IDE-wise: I don't like IDE's. I like editors. As in VIM and GNU/Emacs. I
  learned VIM first and found it damn fast to code in. Then I learned Emacs and
  found it damn powerful. So now I use Emacs with viper-mode; that is, with
  VIM-like controls.

  Most of my experience is with languages used in web applications, which means
  PHP (preferably with CodeIgniter, a bit with Symfony), (X)HTML, JavaScript (with
  JQuery) and CSS. I wrote some semi-trivial apps in Python and solved some
  Project Euler problems with it as well. Due to school I'm OK with Pascal
  (objects too) if I have the help or some reference. I love C and C++ for their
  power and the ruthless way they point out my mistakes (yes, I also like
  NetHack and it's ilk). Some Perl was compulsory for writing small utils.

  When experimenting with XMonad I learned some Haskell. I never found simple
  enough  documentation (or the will) to really understand monads, but I still
  learned the basics of functional programming. Then came a bit of Erlang... Or
  maybe Erlang was first. Whatever. I also read some Common Lisp tutorials and a book or a half
  - this made tuning Emacs easier. Next on my list of things to try - after
  more pressing matters - is literate programming. Also, I did practically zero
  graphics up to now. This site is the result of some experimenting and a lot of luck.
